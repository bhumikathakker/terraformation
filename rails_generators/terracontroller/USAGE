Description:
    The terracontroller generator creates a new controller and optionally its
    views.

    Views are given a .html.haml suffix by default but this can be overridden
    by giving one or both extensions on the command line.

Example:
    ./script/generate terracontroller planets rotate revolve
        ...
        create  spec/controllers/planets_controller_spec.rb
        create  app/controllers/planets_controller.rb
        create  spec/views/planets/rotate.html_spec.rb
        create  app/views/planets/rotate.html.haml
        create  spec/views/planets/revolve.html_spec.rb
        create  app/views/planets/revolve.html.haml

Advanced Example:
    ./script/generate terracontroller 'admin/planets' rotate.html rotate.rss
        ...
        create  spec/controllers/admin/planets_controller_spec.rb
        create  app/controllers/admin/planets_controller.rb
        create  spec/views/admin/planets/rotate.html_spec.rb
        create  app/views/admin/planets/rotate.html.haml
        create  spec/views/admin/planets/rotate.rss_spec.rb
        create  app/views/admin/planets/rotate.rss.builder
